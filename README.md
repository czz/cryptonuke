`cryptonuke` is a ICBM Atomic Bomb Crypt Fallout76 decryptor written in Golang for Fun.

One of my friend Ibic83 came to my house to visit my cat and asked me a tool to decrypt Fallout ICBM code.
I had to learn golang so i made this very basic example. It needs to be implemented with a GUI. 

    go get -u github.com/czz/cryptonuke

## How to?

    go run cryptonuke.go -knowntext B...ST -letters DEFMPRST -numbers 48110398
